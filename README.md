# scratchpad

0. Fork this repo, so you can save changes across class sessions.

1. In Google Colab, create a new notebook.

2. Paste the following commands in a code chunk, and run it:

```python
! git clone https://github.com/ds4e/get_data
%run ./get_data/get_data.py
```

This will download and extract the course data for you.

3. When you're done, save your notebook back to your `scratchpad` repo with today's date.
